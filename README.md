# Shop-Til-You-Drop
Social Sensing and Cyber-Physical Systems - Semester Project

This project will focus on analyzing the overall health of the Consumer Discretionary sector, specifically the Textiles, Apparel, & Luxury Goods industry.  We will use sentiment analysis from Twitter posts to rank leading companies in the industry, identify upcoming brands, and predict fluxes in the stocks for these companies. We will also monitor these companies’ Twitter accounts to see the effect of social media presence and sale postings on corporate reputation. We will see if we can predict the company’s stock market value based on public sentiment, competitors, and the time of year.
